# MovieMobs Angular Client

This project is the front-end client for the MovieMobs application, built using Angular and Angular Material. It provides a user interface for users to browse movies, view details about genres and directors, and manage their user profile.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **Node.js** and **npm**: You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Angular CLI**: Install it globally using npm:
    ```sh
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    cd MOVIEMOBS-FINAL-VERSION-6.5-FRONTEND-TO-START
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start` or `ng serve`

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits to the source files.

### `npm run build` or `ng build`

This builds the application for production to the `dist/` directory. It correctly bundles Angular in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run test` or `ng test`

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode using Karma.

### `npm run watch`

This command builds the project and watches for changes, recompiling automatically.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate new components or other Angular schematics, you can use the `ng generate` command.

* **Generate a component:**
    ```bash
    ng generate component component-name
    ```
   
* **See all available schematics:**
    You can also generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, and modules.

    ng generate --help
    ```
